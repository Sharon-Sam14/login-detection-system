        <h1>About the AI-Powered Login Intrusion Detection System</h1>
        
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            In today's digital world, traditional security measures like passwords are no longer enough. Sophisticated attackers can bypass simple rule-based systems (like IP blacklists) using stolen credentials, making it incredibly difficult to distinguish a legitimate user from a malicious actor. This vulnerability puts sensitive personal and corporate data at constant risk.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>
            This project introduces an intelligent, AI-driven Login Intrusion Detection System (LIDS) built upon a <strong>Bayesian Network</strong>. Instead of relying on rigid rules, our system learns the unique behavioral pattern of each user over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            For every login attempt, the system analyzes a rich set of contextual features—such as geographic location, time of day, device type, and IP reputation—to calculate a probabilistic risk score. By understanding what is "normal" for a user, our model can instantly flag anomalous activities that would be invisible to traditional systems.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Adaptive Security:</strong> The model continuously learns and adapts to a user's changing habits, reducing false alarms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Contextual Awareness:</strong> It understands the relationships between different factors, allowing it to detect subtle inconsistencies that signal an attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Proactive Defense:</strong> By identifying threats in real-time, the system can block unauthorized access before any damage is done, creating a more secure digital environment for everyone.
